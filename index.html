            <h1>Dream Big</h1>
            <h2>Become a Hollywood Supertar</h2>
            <p>Making it in Hollywood: the dream of so many young, aspiring actors for nearly one hundred years.
                Millions have tried
                and few have succeeded, but those who have are the names that echo as synonyms for actors in the annals
                of history.
                Bogart, Baccall, Hepburn, Streep, Hoffman, Washington, Pacino right on through to Gosling, Blanchett and
                Davis. So how
                can you follow in their footsteps? Is it as easy as turning up and handing out your headshot on the
                Sunset strip,
                waiting to be discovered? Getting a job in a bar and cracking out Shakespeare monologues to every
                Tarantino wannabe?
                Sadly not, my friends. What it takes is work, skill, talent, drive, determination and a healthy dose of
                luck.</p>
